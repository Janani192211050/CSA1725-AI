% Base case: sum of integers from 1 to 0 is 0
sum_integers(0, 0).

% Recursive case: sum of integers from 1 to N is N plus the sum of integers from 1 to N-1
sum_integers(N, Sum) :-
    N > 0,                      % Ensure N is a positive integer
    Prev is N - 1,              % Calculate N-1
    sum_integers(Prev, PrevSum), % Recursively sum integers from 1 to N-1
    Sum is N + PrevSum.         % Calculate sum of integers from 1 to N

% Predicate to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to N
sum_up_to_n(N, Sum) :-
    sum_integers(N, Sum).       % Call the sum_integers predicate to calculate the sum

OUTPUT:
?- sum_integers(5, Sum).
Sum = 15
